<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Wuhan Univeristy (Ê≠¶Ê±âÂ§ßÂ≠¶‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩ‰∏éËá™Âä®ÂåñÁ≥ª) with a master's degree, advised by [Zhengmin Kong(Â≠îÊîøÊïè)](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/kongzhengmin/en/index.htm). I'm persuing a phd degree in Wuhan University under the supervision of [Guo-Ping Liu(ÂàòÂõΩÂπ≥)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/guo-pingliu.html). I also collaborate with [Lajos Hanzo](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wxxn8/professor-lajos-hanzo). 

My research interest includes Nonorthogonal multiple access, robust beamforming, optimizaiton and machine learning. I have publish several paper.
